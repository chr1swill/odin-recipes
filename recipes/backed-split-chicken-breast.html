      This is a very easy, but elegant, baked chicken breast recipe that looks
      like you've spent hours in the kitchen when you've barely lifted a finger!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large bone-in chicken breast halves with skin</li>
      <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon garlic, minced</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon coarse sea salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon cracked black pepper</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon dried basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Step 1</strong><br />Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 2</strong><br />Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and
        garlic; sprinkle with salt, black pepper, rosemary, and basil. Arrange
        chicken in a large baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3</strong><br />Refrigerate for at least 45 minutes.
        Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 4</strong><br />Bake in the preheated oven until chicken
        meat is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 45 to 60
        minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of
        the breast meat should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li><strong>Step 4</strong><br />Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
