      One of our go-to recipes for chicken breast that we make often during the
      week because it's so easy. Chicken breast gets marinated in Mediterranean
      flavors like lemon juice, olive oil, and herbs and then baked in the oven.

      <li>
        <strong>Step 1</strong><br />Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper
        on all sides and place in a bowl or lidded container. Combine olive oil,
        lemon juice, garlic, oregano, and thyme in a small bowl and pour
        marinade over chicken breasts. Marinate for 10 minutes at room
        temperature.

        <strong>Step 2</strong><br />Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees
        C). Set one oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.

        <strong>Step 3</strong><br />Place chicken breasts into a baking dish
        and pour marinade on top.

        <strong>Step 4</strong><br />Bake chicken on the middle rack of the
        preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run
        clear, 35 to 45 minutes, depending upon thickness. Move baking dish to
        the top rack and broil chicken until well browned, about 5 minutes
