      An ad on TV sparked the idea for this recipe, and its become a family
      favorite. I usually serve with fettucini and Italian bread. It makes a
      very filling and delicious meal. It also is elegant enough to serve for
      company.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ cups shredded Italian cheese blend (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>½ cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs</li>
      <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>1 egg, well beaten</li>
      <li>1 cup spaghetti sauce</li>
      <li>¼ cup shredded Italian cheese blend, or to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 1</strong><br />Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 2</strong><br />Combine 1 1/2 cup Italian cheese blend,
        garlic, basil, and oregano in a bowl. Combine Parmesan cheese and bread
        crumbs in a separate bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3</strong><br />Cut one side of each chicken breast through
        the middle horizontally to within one-half inch of the other side. Open
        the two sides and spread them out like an open book. Lightly pound
        chicken to flatten. Fill each chicken breast with Italian cheese blend
        mixture and close like a book over the filling. Coat the outside of each
        chicken breast with egg; press bread crumb mixture over egg layer to
        coat each chicken breast. Arrange chicken breasts in a 9x13-inch baking
        dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 4</strong><br />Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is
        no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes.
        An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
        least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Pour spaghetti sauce over cooked
        chicken; top with 1/4 cup Italian cheese blend. Bake until sauce is
        bubbling and cheese is melted, about 5 more minutes.
